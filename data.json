This is a direct conversion from the [original UNPB mod page ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/46580)from n8k.\n\nPieces separated out for mix and match enthuiasts. \n\nThe original meshes were fried in terms of polygons and normals (the heels normals were inside out for some reason), so I did some blender work to fix it up and subdivide the pieces so they have more than 20 polygons each, and a lot of small manual mesh edits. They should be less blocky now and generally have less jarring angular shapes. This is not perfect, of course, but it should at least go from 2013 to maybe 2018.\n\nSMP physics has been added to the dangly bits like the rings and the belt ends. On the textures side, the lace textures have been improved, and there are also two new recolors in the usual colors of roses - red and white.\n\nThere are hand painted weights for immersive physics, with special thanks to [PsychoWedge](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/PsychoWedge) for doing the BHUNP weight painting.\u00a0\n\nAlso, some custom sliders that I will leave as an exercise for the reader to find out what they do.\n\n\ufeff![Image](https://i.imgur.com/gLNfhTJ.png)\ufeff\n\nThese things all have SMP now, yay!\n\nesl flagged esp.

Get the rest of the bodyslide files for gloves and boots there if you'd like.\n\nRequires the original mod, bodyslide, and some modding acumen like knowing how to install FSMP and everything related to it.

The pieces that you'd expect to have physics all have SMP physics now, yay!\n\nThis is partially based on kahvipannu84's 3BA version with squeeze sliders and weights, so this inherits all of the changes made there along with the original SE Kalessin42 3BA version that it's based on. Here I made some more uv, weights, and slider changes of my own, made some new pieces with the assets, and also brought those features to BHUNP because the cult of BHUNP graciously tests and takes screenshots for me.\n\nThis version also uses custom textures from xavbio instead of the vanilla elven armor textures. See credits.\n\nThis version is standalone thanks to the permissions of the previous iterations of this outfit. \n\nesl flagged esp.

I said I will do it later - a wizard is never late or early, so I totally did not just forget about this until a couple months later. I am not the hero SSE deserves or needs, I just convert obscure old outfits badly.\n\nAside from modernizing the bodyslide files to 3BA and BHUNP v4 alongside other stuff like converting to form 44, NiOverride heels instead of HDT, I also gave it some touch ups like using texturesets to save on mesh space, and added a couple of retexture colors. There are four colors for the dress, three for the fur jacket, two for the heels. \n\nIf you have sound record distributor and heels sounds, the heels will have heels sounds.\n\nesl flagged esp. Use additemmenu. Build with bodyslide first. No crafting recipes.",

    "description": "HKX Conversion Tool\n\nHKX Conversion Tool is a GUI wrapper for [serde-hkx ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/126214)for converting Havok files between different formats for Skyrim modding.\n\nI initially started building a wrapper for [hkxcmd](https://github.com/figment/hkxcmd), but since that doesn't handle amd64 hkx files, I was also using [hkxconv ](https://github.com/ret2end/hkxconv)to convert those into xmls first and pushing those xmls through hkxcmd, and then I got upset that the solution was messy and started to look at their source code to try and build a modern version that handles win32, amd64 and xml format conversions between each other. Thankfully I didn't get too far into reinventing the wheel before I found out someone built this already, so I just repurposed the GUI tool for their CLI since It Just Works\u2122.\n\nWorking with havok files is really a pain in the ass, since Blender's hkx plugin can't import Skyrim SE/amd64 hkx formats, they have to all be converted to win32 Oldrim format first. A lot of the existing guides will tell you to find and install Havok Content Tools and use hctStandAloneFilterManager.exe. It annoyed me a lot that the animation modding toolchain basically relies on an obsolete and unsupported tool that you have to find a download for on some google drive folder.\n\nMaybe someone will also reimplement hkanno to not rely on HCT and just work off of xml for annotations editing, then animating and animation modding in 2024 wouldn't be excruciatingly tedious for anyone that has to work with existing animations.\n\nFeatures\n\n* Convert HKX files to XML format and between formats for Skyrim LE and SE\n\n* Convert XML files to HKX format for Skyrim LE and SE\n\n* Batch conversion support\n\n* User-friendlier GUI interface\n\n* Specify output folder and suffix options\n\nInstallation\n\n[list=1]\n\n* Download the latest release.\n\n* Extract the zip file to your desired location.\n\n* Run hkxtools.exe file.\n\nUsage\n\n[list=1]\n\n* Launch the application.\n\n* Click \"Browse Input Files\" to select the HKX or XML files you want to convert.\n\n* (Optional) Set the output folder by clicking \"Browse\" next to \"Output Folder\".\n\n* (Optional) Enter a suffix for the output files.\n\n* Select the desired output format (XML, Skyrim LE, or Skyrim SE).\n\n* Click \"Run Conversion\" to start the conversion process.\n\nLicense\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see below for details:\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2023\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\n\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
