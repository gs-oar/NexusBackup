Previous conversions to SSE have all just coped with the issues with the meshes, which I have tried to address here. Let's say this is Black Rose Refreshed? This is a direct conversion from the [original UNPB mod page ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/46580)from n8k.\n\nPieces separated out for mix and match enthuiasts. \n\nThe original meshes were fried in terms of polygons and normals (the heels normals were inside out for some reason), so I did some blender work to fix it up and subdivide the pieces so they have more than 20 polygons each, and a lot of small manual mesh edits. They should be less blocky now and generally have less jarring angular shapes. This is not perfect, of course, but it should at least go from 2013 to maybe 2018.\n\nSMP physics has been added to the dangly bits like the rings and the belt ends. On the textures side, the lace textures have been improved, and there are also two new recolors in the usual colors of roses - red and white.\n\nThere are hand painted weights for immersive physics, with special thanks to [PsychoWedge](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/PsychoWedge) for doing the BHUNP weight painting.\u00a0\n\nAlso, some custom sliders that I will leave as an exercise for the reader to find out what they do.\n\n\ufeff![Image](https://i.imgur.com/gLNfhTJ.png)\ufeff\n\nThese things all have SMP now, yay!\n\nesl flagged esp.

Added SMP to the earrings, and the two scarf pieces also have SMP rigged to separate bones and can move independently of each other, look at the screenshots for some cool examples.\n\nThis is a direct conversion from Oldrim based on the [original gutris1 mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77070). There are no new pieces this time because the original permissions precluded any mashups. The crossbow is not included here either because the permissions says I can't.\n\nThis version uses custom ebony textures from xavbio instead of the vanilla textures. There's also two recolor texture variants available as optional downloads.\n\nesl flagged esp. Use additemmenu, or there are crafting recipes that require ebony smithing.

Shall we call this Elvenia 2025?\n\nSpecific changes:\n\nPieces separated out so they can be equipped and unequipped separately, some new pieces created from the same assets, added SMP to the belly tassels thing, and a variety of zap sliders and adjustment sliders. The pieces that you'd expect to have physics all have SMP physics now, yay!\n\nThis is partially based on kahvipannu84's 3BA version with squeeze sliders and weights, so this inherits all of the changes made there along with the original SE Kalessin42 3BA version that it's based on. Here I made some more uv, weights, and slider changes of my own, made some new pieces with the assets, and also brought those features to BHUNP because the cult of BHUNP graciously tests and takes screenshots for me.\n\nThis version also uses custom textures from xavbio instead of the vanilla elven armor textures. See credits.\n\nThis version is standalone thanks to the permissions of the previous iterations of this outfit. \n\nesl flagged esp. Use additemmenu, or there are actually crafting recipes this time as well that requires elven smithing.

I am not the hero SSE deserves or needs, I just convert obscure old outfits badly.\n\nAside from modernizing the bodyslide files to 3BA and BHUNP v4 alongside other stuff like converting to form 44, NiOverride heels instead of HDT, I also gave it some touch ups like using texturesets to save on mesh space, and added a couple of retexture colors. There are four colors for the dress, three for the fur jacket, two for the heels. \n\nIf you have sound record distributor and heels sounds, the heels will have heels sounds.\n\nesl flagged esp.

    "description": "HKX Conversion Tool\n\nHKX Conversion Tool is a GUI wrapper for [serde-hkx ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/126214)for converting Havok files between different formats for Skyrim modding.\n\nI initially started building a wrapper for [hkxcmd](https://github.com/figment/hkxcmd), but since that doesn't handle amd64 hkx files, I was also using [hkxconv ](https://github.com/ret2end/hkxconv)to convert those into xmls first and pushing those xmls through hkxcmd, and then I got upset that the solution was messy and started to look at their source code to try and build a modern version that handles win32, amd64 and xml format conversions between each other. Thankfully I didn't get too far into reinventing the wheel before I found out someone built this already, so I just repurposed the GUI tool for their CLI since It Just Works\u2122.\n\nWorking with havok files is really a pain in the ass, since Blender's hkx plugin can't import Skyrim SE/amd64 hkx formats, they have to all be converted to win32 Oldrim format first. A lot of the existing guides will tell you to find and install Havok Content Tools and use hctStandAloneFilterManager.exe. It annoyed me a lot that the animation modding toolchain basically relies on an obsolete and unsupported tool that you have to find a download for on some google drive folder.\n\nMaybe someone will also reimplement hkanno to not rely on HCT and just work off of xml for annotations editing, then animating and animation modding in 2024 wouldn't be excruciatingly tedious for anyone that has to work with existing animations.\n\nFeatures\n\n* Convert HKX files to XML format and between formats for Skyrim LE and SE\n\n* Convert XML files to HKX format for Skyrim LE and SE\n\n* Batch conversion support\n\n* User-friendlier GUI interface\n\n* Specify output folder and suffix options\n\nInstallation\n\n[list=1]\n\n* Download the latest release.\n\n* Extract the zip file to your desired location.\n\n* Run hkxtools.exe file.\n\nUsage\n\n[list=1]\n\n* Launch the application.\n\n* Click \"Browse Input Files\" to select the HKX or XML files you want to convert.\n\n* (Optional) Set the output folder by clicking \"Browse\" next to \"Output Folder\".\n\n* (Optional) Enter a suffix for the output files.\n\n* Select the desired output format (XML, Skyrim LE, or Skyrim SE).\n\n* Click \"Run Conversion\" to start the conversion process.\n\nLicense\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see below for details:\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2023\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\n\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Non-AE users try [Sync Wig Hair Color](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48311?tab=description).\n\nRequires TNG distribution and either CBBE 3BA or BHUNP.\n\nSome options contain a lot of polygons and might impact performance. For people on modern computers as long as you don't have 30 naked characters in a single room it should probably be fine since it will normally be hidden on clothed characters.\n\nIt would probably be a lot more practical to use hair cards and textures instead of having individual hair strands, but I don't know how to do that so this is what you will get.\n\nBodyslide files for CBBE 3BA are included in the main files. BHUNP and UBE bodyslides available in optional files. No prebuilt meshes, batch building meshes required before use.",

This replaces animations for the female character character.\n\nOn top of the original animations by Gunslicer, there are some OAR config changes to improve condition triggers as well as some subjectively improved variations of existing animations. Currently only weapons-sheathed sneak and two handed sneak have adjusted variations, but there may be more to come later.\n\nfomod installer includes links to preview videos for some animations hosted on a [github pages site](https://gs-oar.github.io/gunslicer-oar/index.html), but so far it does not cover all of the animations currently included in the pack. Preview video submissions are welcomed as well as suggestions for OAR config changes or even animation changes if you wish to have them bundled in this pack, you can find guidelines on how to do so on the github repository readme [here](https://github.com/gs-oar/gunslicer-oar).",

    "game": "skyrimspecialedition",
    "summary": "Provides Python based automation scripts for generating yaml files for clothing mods for converting into esp files using Spriggit",
    "description": "Clothing Mod Esp Record Automation Script for Spriggit\n\nOverview\n\nThis project provides an automation tool for generating yaml files for clothing mods for converting into esp files using [Spriggit](https://mutagen-modding.github.io/Spriggit/). The configuration and input data are specified in yaml files, and the tool handles the creation of necessary files and their conversion. This is primarily useful for outfit mods with multiple texture variants, as the scripts handle FormKey creation and naming for Armor, ArmorAddons and TextureSet records. \n\nIn my own workflow this goes after I have created the bodyslide files with the meshes and processed the textures, since this also contains a helper script to automatically generate the input mesh name list for use here based on bodyslide .osp files. I made this for my own use because creating color variants for items is very time consuming and repetitive, but hopefully this will also save other people time.\n\nFeatures\n\n* Generate TextureSet, ArmorAddon, and Armor records in yaml format.\n\n* Handles FormKey and EditorID creation and automatic renaming/renumbering, TextureSet texture map setting, AlternateTextures setting with 3D index and shape name inputs.\n\n* Intended for converting generated yaml files into esp files using Spriggit.\n\n* Inputs specified in inputs.yaml, settings configurable through config.yaml.\n\n* Automatically infers body slots based on item names and sets appropriate slots, keywords, and values using configurable mappings.\n\nPrerequisites\n\n* Python 3.x and its standard libraries\n\n* pyyaml\n\nSetup\n\n[list=1]\n\n* Clone the repository to your local machine.\n\n* Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.\n\n* Install pyyaml.\n\n* Configurate inputs.yaml to specify each clothing piece and texture variants.\n\n* Run GenerateModFromInputs.py to generate yaml_output which will contain the files for Spriggit.\n\n* Deserialize the yaml files back into an esp file with Spriggit.\n\n* Open CK or SSEEdit and apply the esl flag, Spriggit doesn't handle number of records correctly yet so you will need to fix this manually.\n\nConfiguration\n\nAll configuration settings are stored in the config.yaml file. Below is an example configuration:\n\n[code]spriggit_cli_path: \"./Path/To/Spriggit.CLI.exe\"\n\ninput_directory: \"./yaml_output\"\n\nesp_name: \"MyMod.esp\"\n\nmesh_output_dir: \"./meshes/output\"\n\ntexture_sets_dir: \"./yaml_output/TextureSets\"\n\narmor_addons_dir: \"./yaml_output/ArmorAddons\"\n\narmors_dir: \"./yaml_output/Armors\"\n\nrecord_data_path: \"./yaml_output/RecordData.yaml\"\n\nspriggit_meta_path: \"./yaml_output/spriggit.meta\"[/code]\n\nExample inputs.yaml\n\nThis is the primary input file where you specify armor records in plain text which will get converted into yaml files and eventually esp. This is a lot faster than working in CreaitonKit or SSEEdit because you can copy and paste blocks and add name suffixes or change texture paths easily. A more detailed schema is included in the default inputs.yaml file.\n\nI have also included a helper script ReadOspGenInputMeshes.py to generate the mesh_name_input list based on Bodyslide SliderSet folder contents. It will also provide you with a list of shapes for each mesh.\n\n[code]mesh_name_input:\n\n\u00a0 - MultipleTextureMesh\n\n\u00a0 - SingleTextureMesh\n\ntexture_set_input:\n\n\u00a0 MultipleTextureMesh:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Red:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Diffuse: \"Path/To/Diffuse.dds\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NormalOrGloss: \"Path/To/Normal.dds\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MeshName: \"Mesh1\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MeshIndex: 0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Diffuse: \"Path/To/Diffuse2.dds\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NormalOrGloss: \"Path/To/Normal2.dds\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MeshName: \"Mesh2\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MeshIndex: 1\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Blue:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Diffuse: \"Path/To/BlueDiffuse.dds\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NormalOrGloss: \"Path/To/BlueNormal.dds\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MeshName: \"Mesh1\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MeshIndex: 0\n\n\u00a0 SingleTextureMesh:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Green:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 - Diffuse: \"Path/To/GreenDiffuse.dds\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NormalOrGloss: \"Path/To/GreenNormal.dds\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MeshName: \"Mesh2\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MeshIndex: 0\n\n[/code]\n\nExample maps.yaml\n\nThe maps.yaml file sets configs for automating the process of adding keywords, setting bodyslots, and setting value, weight and armor rating for each piece of clothing. This file contains mappings that directs the script to automatically infer body slot types based on item names and set the appropriate slots, keywords, and values. I have included a default config for this file that I use, a simple example to demonstrate the schema below:\n\n[code]first_person_flags_map:\n\n\u00a0 Head: [\"Helmet\", \"Hat\"]\n\n\u00a0 Body: [\"Armor\", \"Robe\"]\n\nkeywords_map:\n\n\u00a0 Head: [\"ArmorHelmet\", \"ClothingHead\"] # Just for reference, you need to use the actual FormKeys of the keywords here\n\n\u00a0 Body: [\"ArmorBody\", \"ClothingBody\"]\n\narmor_values_map:\n\n\u00a0 Head:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Value: 100\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Weight: 1.0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ArmorRating: 10\n\n\u00a0 Body:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Value: 500\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Weight: 5.0\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ArmorRating: 50\n\n[/code]\n\nProject Structure\n\n[code]\u251c\u2500\u2500 config.yaml            \u00a0 # Config file\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ModGenClass.py         \u00a0 # Contains the class object for parsing config and input yamls\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ReadOspGenInputMeshes.py # Helper script to automatically generate mesh names from Bodyslide SliderSet folders for input\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 GenerateModFromInputs.py # Main script to run the generation process\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 maps.yaml                # Yaml config to determine bodyslots, keywords and armor value mapping\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 inputs.yaml            \u00a0 # Yaml file to specify the inputs for each clothing piece of the mod\n\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 templates.py             # Contains text templates for esp record types\n\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md                # This documentation file[/code]\n\nLicense\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit).",

    "description": "I made some edits to [Gunslicer's sneak animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61159). Because Skyrim's simplistic skeleton rig is not very good, the original animation's neck shape is very screwed up. See comparison photo.\n\nIn light of this, I adjusted the neck position. I made adjustments to the spine as well since I thought the original animation's spine/back was too flat, this also helped with the neck position, overall I think it looks less unnatural.\n\nI only adjusted sneakmtidle, sneakrun_forward, and sneakwalk_forward since I use true directional movement and the other animations don't get called. If you don't use true directional movement you will get the original animations when you move in other directions.\n\nThe animations are in OAR format, which means you will need it for this to work. The trigger conditions are female player character with weapons sheathed. \n\nI also threw in an alternate squat idle that I made that will be randomly chosen alongside Gunslicer's idle, you can delete the sneakmtidle2.hkx file if you don't like it.",
